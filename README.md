# Phase 3 SQLAlchemy Code Challenge: Restaurants

For this assignment, we'll be working with a restaurant review domain.

## Migrations

Before working on the rest of the deliverables, you will need to create a migration for all tables.

- A `Review` belongs to a `Restaurant`, and a `Review` also belongs to a  `Customer`.  In your migration, create any columns your `reviews` table will

 need to establish these relationships.

The `reviews` table should also have:  - A `star_rating` column that stores an integer.
 
After creating the `reviews` table using a migration, use the `seeds.py` file to create instances of all your classes so you can test your code.
 

# Object Relationship Methods
 

Use SQLAlchemy query methods where appropriate.

 
## Review
- `Review customer()`

 - should return the `Customer` instance for this review

- `Review restaurant()`

 - should return the `Restaurant` instance for this review

 

## Restaurant
 

- `Restaurant reviews()`

 - returns a collection of all the reviews for the `Restaurant`

- `Restaurant customers()`

 - returns a collection of all the customers who reviewed the `Restaurant`

 

## Customer
 

- `Customer reviews()`

 - should return a collection of all the reviews that the `Customer` has left

- `Customer restaurants()`

 - should return a collection of all the restaurants that the `Customer` has reviewed

 

# Aggregate and Relationship Methods
 

## Customer
 

- `Customer full_name()`

 - returns the full name of the customer, with the first name and the last name  concatenated, Western style.

- `Customer favorite_restaurant()`

 - returns the restaurant instance that has the highest star rating from this customer

- `Customer add_review(restaurant, rating)`

 - takes a `restaurant` (an instance of the `Restaurant` class) and a rating

 - creates a new review for the restaurant with the given `restaurant_id`

- `Customer delete_reviews(restaurant)`

 - takes a `restaurant` (an instance of the `Restaurant` class) and

 - removes **all** their reviews for this restaurant

 - you will have to delete rows from the `reviews` table to get this to work!


## Review
- `Review full_review()`

 - should return a string formatted as follows:
Review for {insert restaurant name} by {insert customer's full name}: {insert review star_rating} stars.

 

## Restaurant

- `Restaurant fanciest(), this method should be a class method`

 - returns _one_ restaurant instance for the restaurant that has the highest price

- `Restaurant all_reviews()`

 - should return an list of strings with all the reviews for this restaurant formatted as follows:
